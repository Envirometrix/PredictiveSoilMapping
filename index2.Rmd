## Editors {-}

[**Tom Hengl**](https://opengeohub.org/people/tom-hengl) is a Senior Researcher 
and Vice Chair of the OpenGeoHub Foundation / technical director at 
Envirometrix Ltd. Tom has more than 20 years of experience as an environmental 
modeler, data scientist and spatial analyst. He is a passionate advocate for, 
and supporter of, open data, reproducible science and career development 
for young scientists. He designed and implemented the global [SoilGrids](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169748) data set, 
partially in response to other well known open data projects such as 
OpenStreetMap, GBIF, GlobalForestWatch and global climate mapping projects. 
He has taught predictive soil mapping at Wageningen University / ISRIC within 
the “Hands-on-GSIF” block courses. Video tutorials on predictive soil mapping 
with R can also be found at http://youtube.com/c/ISRICorg and 
https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenGeoHubFoundation. Tom currently 
leads the production of a web mapping system called “LandGIS” 
(https://landgis.opengeohub.org) which is envisaged as *“an OpenStreetMap-type system”* 
for land-related environmental data. The system hosts global, fine spatial 
resolution data (250 m to 1 km) including various soil classes and soil 
properties, which is intended for eventual integration and use at operational 
or farm-scales.

[**Bob MacMillan**](https://opengeohub.org/people/bob-macmillan) is a retired 
environmental consultant with over 40 years of experience in creating, 
packaging, delivering and using environmental information on soils, ecosystems, 
landforms and hydrology. Bob spent 19 years working in public sector research 
with the Alberta Research Council and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and a 
second 20 years as a private sector consultant offering services in predictive 
soil and ecological mapping. Since retiring, Bob has remained an active 
supporter, promoter, advocate, mentor and technical contributor to several 
continental to global scale efforts to advance the science and technology of 
mapping soils and other ecosystem components. As Science Coordinator for the 
GlobalSoilMap project, Bob helped to articulate the vision for the project 
and led initial activities aimed at achieving this, including authoring 
technical specifications, promoting the project, recruiting 
participants/cooperators, and liaising with representatives of national 
and international soil agencies. Bob continues to contribute on a voluntary 
basis to OpenGeoHub and the Africa Soil Information Servicce (AfSIS) 
(http://africasoils.net). Throughout his career, Bob has shared his 
expertise and his enthusiasm freely with dozens of younger scientists 
interested in learning about, and becoming, practitioners of digital soil 
mapping. Bob continues to support the next generation of digital soil mappers 
through his involvement with OpenGeoHub.

# Preface {-}

Predictive Soil Mapping (PSM) is based on applying statistical and/or machine 
learning techniques to fit models for the purpose of producing spatial and/or 
spatiotemporal predictions of soil variables, i.e. maps of soil properties and 
classes at different resolutions. It is a multidisciplinary field combining 
statistics, data science, soil science, physical geography, remote sensing, 
geoinformation science and a number of other sciences [@Scul01; @McBratney2003Geoderma; @Henderson2004Geoderma; @Boettinger2010Springer; @Zhu2015PSM]. *Predictive Soil Mapping with R* 
is about understanding the main concepts behind soil mapping, mastering R 
packages that can be used to produce high quality soil maps, and about 
optimizing all processes involved so that production costs can also be reduced.

The main differences between predictive vs traditional expert-based soil 
mapping are that: (a) the production of maps 
is based on using state-of-the-art statistical methods to ensure objectivity of 
maps (including objective uncertainty assessment vs expert judgment), and (b) 
PSM is driven by automation of the processes so that overall soil data 
production costs can be reduced and updates of maps implemented without 
requirements for large investments. R, in that sense, is a logical platform 
to develop PSM workflows and applications, especially thanks to the vibrant 
and productive R spatial interest group activities and also thanks to the 
increasingly professional soil data packages such as, for example: soiltexture, 
aqp, soilprofile, soilDB and similar.

The book is divided into sections covering theoretical concepts, preparation 
of covariates, model selection and evaluation, prediction and final practical 
tips for operational PSM. Most of the chapters contain R code examples that 
try to illustrate the main processing steps and give practical instructions to 
developers and applied users.

## Contributions {-}

This book is designed to be constantly updated and contributions are always 
welcome (through pull requests, but also through adding new chapters) provided 
that some minimum requirements are met. To contribute a new chapter please 
contact the editors first. Some minimum requirements to contribute a chapter are:

1. The data needs to be available for the majority of tutorials presented in a 
chapter. It is best if this is via some R package or web-source.
2. A chapter should ideally focus on implementing some computing in R (it should be written as an R tutorial).
3. All examples should be computationally efficient requiring not more than 30 secs of computing time per process on a single core system.
4. The theoretical basis for methods and interpretation of results should be based on peer-review publications. This book is not intended to report on primary research / experimental results, but only to supplement existing research publications.
5. A chapter should consist of at least 1500 words and at most 3500 words.
6. The topic of the chapter must be closely connected to the theme of soil mapping, soil geographical databases, methods for processing spatial soil data and similar.

In principle, all submitted chapters should follow closely also the [five pillars of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars), especially: Verifiability, Reproducibility, No original research, Neutral point of view, Good faith, No conflict of interest, and No personal attacks.

This book has been inspired by [the Geocomputation with R book](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net), 
an Open Access book edited by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad and Jannes Muenchow. 
Many thanks to Robin Lovelace for helping with rmarkdown and for giving some 
initial tips for compiling and organizing this book. The authors are also 
grateful to the numerous software/package developers, especially Edzer Pebesma, 
Roger Bivand, Robert Hijmans, Markus Neteler, Tim Appelhans, and Hadley Wickham, 
whose contributions have enabled a generation of researchers and applied projects. 

We are especially grateful to [Jakub Nowosad](https://nowosad.github.io/) for helping with preparing this publication for press and with setting up all code so that it passes automatic checks.

OpenGeoHub is a not-for-profit research foundation with headquarters in 
Wageningen, the Netherlands (Stichting OpenGeoHub, KvK 71844570). The main goal 
of the OpenGeoHub is to promote publishing and sharing of Open Geographical and 
Geoscientific Data and using and developing of Open Source Software. We believe 
that the key measure of quality of research in all sciences (and especially in 
geographical information sciences) is in transparency and reproducibility of 
the computer code used to generate results. Transparency and reproducibility 
increase trust in information so that it is eventually also the fastest path to 
optimal decision making.

Every effort has been made to trace copyright holders of the materials used in 
this publication. Should we, despite all our efforts, have overlooked 
contributors please contact the author and we shall correct this unintentional 
omission without any delay and will acknowledge any overlooked contributions
