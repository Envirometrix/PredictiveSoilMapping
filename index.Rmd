## Editors {-}

[Tom Hengl](http://envirometrix.net/staff) is a Senior Researchers / technical director at Envirometrix Ltd. 
He has more than 20 years of experience as an environmental modeller, data scientist and spatial analyst. 
Tom is a passionate advocate for, and supporter of, open data, reproducable science and career development 
for young scientists. He has desiged and implemented the global [SoilGrids](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169748) dataset, 
partially in response to other well known open data projects such as OpenStreetMap, GBIF, GlobalForestWatch 
and global climate mapping projects. He has been teaching predictive soil mapping at Wageningen University / 
ISRIC within the “Hands-on-GSIF” block courses. Video tutorials of the soil mapping with R can also be 
found at http://youtube.com/c/ISRICorg

# Preface {-}

Predictive Soil Mapping (PSM) is based on applying statistical and/or machine learning techniques to fit models for the purpose of producing spatial and/or spatiotemporal predictions of soil variables i.e. maps of soil properties and classes at different resolutions. It is a multidisciplinary field combining statistics, data science, soil science, physical geography, remote sensing, geoinformation science and number of other sciences [@Scul01; @MCBRATNEY20033; @Henderson2004Geoderma; @Boettinger2010Springer; @Zhu2015PSM]. *Predictive Soil Mapping with R* is about understanding the main concepts behind soil mapping, mastering R packages that can be used to produce high quality soil maps, and about optimizing all processes involved so that also the production costs can be reduced.

The main idea behind Predictive vs traditional expert-based soil mapping is that production of maps: (a) 
is based on using state-of-the-art statistical methods to ensure objectivity of maps (including objective uncertainty assessment vs expert judgment), and (b) is driven by automation of the processes so that overall soil data production costs can be reduced and updates of the maps implemented without a need for large investments. R in that sense is a logical platform to develop PSM workflows and applications, especially thanks to the vibrant and productive R spatial interest group activities and also thanks to the increasingly professional soil data packages such as the soiltexture, aqp, soilprofile, soilDB and similar.

Book is divided into sections covering theoretical concepts, preparation of covariates, model selection and evaluation, prediction and visualization and distribution of final maps. Most of chapters contain R code examples that try to illustrate main processing steps and give practical instructions to developers and applied users.

## Contributions {-}

This book is constantly updated and contributions are welcome (through pull requests, but also through adding new chapters) provided that some minimum requirements are met. To contribute a complete new chapter please contact the editors first. Some minimum requirements to contribute a chapter are:

1. The data needs to be available in majority of chapter, best via some R package or web-source.
2. Chapter should focus on implementing computing in R (it should be written as R tutorial).
3. All examples should be computationally efficient with not more than 30 secs of computing time per process on a single core system.
4. Theoretical basis for methods and interpretation of results should be based on peer-review publications. This book is not intended to host primary research / experimental results, but only to supplement existing research publications.
5. Chapter should consist of at least 1500 words and at most 3500 words.
6. The topic of the chapter must be closely connected to theme of soil mapping, soil geographical databases, methods for processing spatial soil data and similar.

In principle, all submitted chapters should also follow closely the [five pillars of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars), especially: Verifiability, Reproducibility, No original research, Neutral point of view, Good faith, No conflict of interest, and no personal attacks.
